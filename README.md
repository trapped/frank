#FRANK

FRANK is an IRC bot written in Common Lisp
specifically for the #frank (but used in
other channels as well) channel.

Commands are called by prefixing them with
either "$: " (where $ is the name of the bot)
or ".".

Currently implemented commands:
- `help <command>`
- `quit <message>`
- `addquote <text>`
- `getquote [id]`
- `reload`
- `randn <seed>`
